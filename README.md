A mobile game to build your own baseball dream team and have them play against other teams. (Spring 2018 UCF Class Project for Process for Object Oriented Software Course)

This project began with requirements gathering (January - March 2018) followed by development and acceptance testing (March - April 2018).

The idea behind this project was simple: create a mobile app where users could collect baseball cards, build their own team from those cards, and then play a baseball game with other users.

To this end, we decided on a Unity project. Since it leverages the power of the Mono framework to build games on both iOS and Android, we knew it would be the perfect choice to achieve our goal. The next big decision to make was where data would be hosted.

While there were other backend options for game storage, we ultimately decided on Google's Realtime Database: Firebase.
